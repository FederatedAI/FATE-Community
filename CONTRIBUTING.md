# Contributing Guide

FATE is an inclusive and open community. We welcome developers and users who are interested in making FATE better! Contributions of all types are welcome â€” opening issues, fixing typos, adding examples, bug fixes, or entire features.

If you plan on contributing, please go through the existing issues and PRs to ensure no one else has been working on something similar. If no similar feature exists, please open an issue to describe what you plan to do. In this way, you can get feedback from the maintainers and the community. After an agreement has been reached between you and the community, you can start your implementation and contribute your code when you are done. 

You can contact the maintainers by email (FedAI-maintainers @ groups.io) if needed. 

This document covers the genernal guideline about contributing to FATE projects.
However, there are different guidelines in different repositories of FATE. Please do read about the contributing guidelines of each repository to understand the process to participate.

Please note, any contribution and interaction on any FATE projects MUST follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Developer Certificate of Origin

All FATE repositories enforce the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) on Pull Requests(PR). It requires all commit messages to contain the `Signed-off-by` line with an email address that matches the commit author. The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Please make sure you have **signed every commit** with DCO. If your PR fails the DCO checking, your contribution cannot be accepted. 

Contributors *sign-off* by adding a  `Signed-off-by` line to commit messages.

```
This is my commit message.

Signed-off-by: Random Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

The Git command has a `-s` command line option to append DCO automatically to your commit message:

```sh
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message.'
```

If you are not familiar with DCO, please check [this website](https://www.dita-ot.org/dco) for more information.
