# Decision making and voting #

- Decision making process should be transparent to adhere to the principles of FATE project.
- If any decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, TSC member will vote on a one vote per voting TSC member basis.
- Quorum for voting requires all voting TSC member to participate. 
- Any decisions require to be supported by a majority approval of TSC member vote.
- For formal votes, a specific statement of what is being voted on should be added to the relevant GitHub issue or PR, and a link to that issue or PR should be added to the TSC meeting agenda document. TSC member should indicate their yes/no vote on that issue or PR, and after a reasonable period of time, the votes will be tallied and the outcome will be noted.
- All proposals, ideas, and decisions made by TSC member should either be part of a GitHub issue or PR.

# TSC meeting #
TSC meetings include the TSC Board meeting and the TSC regular meeting, with the agenda and form of each meeting as follows:

**TSC Board Meeting**
- This meeting is held irregularly, and called and chaired by the TSC Chair or any board member;
- The agenda of the meeting includes the discussion and communication of major issues including rules and regulations, project direction, project cooperation, community development and community operation, the election of the Chair, and voting on relevant issues.

- TSC members shall not be absent from meetings more than 2 times in a year; otherwise, the member could be removed from the TSC Board or TSC Maintainer.
# Responsibilities #
- Making a community work requires input/effort from everyone. Maintainers should actively participate in Pull Request reviews. Maintainers are expected to respond to assigned Pull Requests in a reasonable time frame, either providing insights, or assigning it to other maintainers. And make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or close them.
- Diligently providing supports (via mailing list, GitHub, slack, email, WeChat, etc.), answering questions，responding to requests and replying to bugs, etc.
- Publishing releases
- Fixing bugs
- Writing and updating documentation for usage and development
- Getting the word out and making your project known 
- Monitoring the improper speech and behavior of the community and dealing with community conflicts and disputes. 
# Project #
## Release cadence ##
- Our current release cycle is intended to be two months. We may change this based on user demand.
- In general, master is assumed to be release candidate quality at all times for documented features. For undocumented or clearly under development features, use caution or ask about current status when running master.
## Proposal Process ##
Significant changes to the codebase and / or new features must be first discussed and weighed, and sometimes formally documented, before they can be implemented. The process for proposal informs and involves all the members of the community in major improvements to the codebase and / or new features throughout the development process, to increase their sharing comments and ideas and offering to help.

The proposal process is the process for reviewing a proposal and reaching an agreement on whether to accept or decline the proposal.

**Design Documents**

The proposal should be documented as a separated markdown file pushed to the root of the `proposals` folder in the community repository via PR. The name of the file should follow the name pattern `design/shortname.md`.
Use the [Proposal Template](./PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md) as a starting point.

**Proposal lifecycle**  
The proposal PR can be marked with different status labels to represent the status of the proposal:

- **New**: Proposal is just created
- **Reviewing**: Proposal is under review and discussion
- **Accepted**: Proposal is reviewed and accepted (either by consensus or vote)
- **Rejected**: Proposal is reviewed and rejected (either by consensus or vote)

**Proposal Review**

The maintainers hold “proposal review meetings” approximately weekly to review pending proposals.

The principal goal of the review meeting is to make sure that proposals are receiving attention from the right people, by cc'ing relevant developers, raising important questions, pinging lapsed discussions, and generally trying to guide discussion toward agreement about the outcome. The discussion itself is expected to happen on the issue tracker, so that anyone can take part in.

Once comments and revisions on the design doc wind down, there is a final discussion on the issue, to reach one of two outcomes:

- Accepted proposal or
- Declined proposal

After the proposal is accepted, implementation work proceeds in the same way as any other contribution.
