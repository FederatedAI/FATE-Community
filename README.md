# FATE Community 
FATE is an inclusive and open community. This repository stores the documentation related to the activities of the FATE community. It serves as 
a place for community members to collaborate together.

# Governance 
FATE is an open source project hosted by Linux Foundation. The [Technical Charter](FATE_Project_Technical_Charter.pdf) sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, 
and oversight of, the FATE (“Federated AI Technology Enabler”) Project. [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) defines the governance model of the project. 

# Technical Steering Committee 

The Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”) is responsible for all technical oversight of the FATE open source project.
The TSC consists of the [TSC Board](TSC%20Board.md) and the [TSC Maintainers](TSC%20MAINTAINERS.md). The roles and resposibilites of the TSC Board and the TSC Maintainers are documented in the [Technical Charter](FATE_Project_Technical_Charter.pdf).

Under the leadership of the TSC, the [Development Committee](./meeting-minutes/FATE_Dev_Meeting) sets up democratic, open and public processes for the community to collaboratively develop the project. The Development Committee forms a few [Special Interest Groups (SIGs)](./SIGs) to discuss, review and determine the strategies of topics in a specific domain, such as security, interoperability and architecture design.  

The TSC Board, TSC Maintainers and Development Committee meet regularly mostly through online meetings. The meeting minutes can be found [here](./meeting-minutes).


# Security Process 
The Security Response Committee (SRC) follows the disclosure and response policies formulated in the [Security Release Process](SECURITY.md) to ensure that key security concerns and issues are addressed promptly and responsibly.

Community members who have security concerns should follow the [Security Release Process](SECURITY.md) to report their issues to the SRC for verification and obtain any remediation measures if needed.
