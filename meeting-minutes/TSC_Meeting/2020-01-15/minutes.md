## Minutes

### R&D Planning

Introduce several key project directions of FATE in 2020 including FATE-Cloud, FATE-Serving, FATE-Board, FATE-On-Spark, KubeFATE, Fed-Recommendation.Clarified the KubeFATE and its combination with FATE-Flow are the key points.

Clarified the following goals:
1. Support for larger-scale data and enhance robustness of offline systems (switch Eggroll to 2.x version).
2. Version upgrade optimization & improve backward compatibility.
3. Covering majority conventional modeling methods for commercial scenario.
4. Enhance visualization & auditability of federal modeling algorithm process.
5. Algorithm acceleration & heterogeneous computing support.
6. Deeper support for deep learning scenarios.
7. Improve online inference services in stability, highly available, high performance, easy to deploy, easy to expand and easy to migrate.
8. Support for multiple secure computing protocols.
9. Interact with mainstream AI frameworks such as Tensorflow, Pytorch, PaddlePaddle etc.

### Operational Planning
1. Introduce milestones of 2020 Operational Planning
2. Salon: hold 4-5 technical salons in different cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wuhan
3. Conference: Promote FATE at domestic and international conferences such as Opensource summit, KubeCon
4. Safety standards: continue to promote technical standards, national secret certification, etc.
5. Establish regular open source community user meetings through Zoom

### Commercialization Discussions

1. In the first half of 2020, FATE will focus on product software polishing which means making the software functionality and stability more complete before carry out large-scale commercialization. Small-scale market commercial promotion and poc verification can be conducted in the early stage.
2. Commercial software closed-loop: Inter-operate with other BI software to achieve closed-loop commercial product requirements.
3. Discussed about how to establish a business demand collection mechanism.
