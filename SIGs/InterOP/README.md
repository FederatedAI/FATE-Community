# FATE SIG on InterOP

## FATE SIG on InterOP focuses on the following topics:
* Framework Design: Design a neutral interoperability framework to inter-connect  heterogeneous PPC(privacy-preserving computing) platforms.  
* API and workflow definition: Define the interoperable API Interface, description and invoke samples.
* Evaluating how to adapt FATE to the interoperable architecture. 
* Verification: Work with leading commercial PPC solutions to verify the interoperability framework and operate integration test.
* Sharing latest research results and practical cases on interoperability. 
* Assist in solving problems related to interoperability.  


## Tasks
* Group formation
* Create InterOP repository
* Propose the interoperability framework
* Define API and workflow of each module
* FATE adaptation
* Invite candidate PPC solutions to adapt to the interoperability framework
* Test and evaluation
