# FATE Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

## What is FATE SIGs?

The FATE Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are a vital part of the FATE ecosystem and provide expert advice and suggestions of a particular area or direction for the FATE community. A FATE SIG can include existing maintainers of the FATE community, external experts of a specific area, or anyone who can contribute to the FATE project in this particular direction. We have two active FATE SIGs now: SIG Security and SIG Tool.

## How is the FATE SIGs involved in the development process of FATE?

Currently, the development of FATE is led by the FATE OSS Dev Team under the supervision of the FATE TSC Board. The FATE OSS Dev Team is responsible for requirements gathering, R&D, testing, and other FATE development-related works. FATE SIGs should assist in a particular area based on the requirements from the FATE OSS Dev Team. Possible involvement approaches include but are not limited to discussion on GitHub, online zoom meeting, offline meeting and so on. Minimally, each FATE SIG has a monthly online zoom meeting. Note all activities of FATE SIGs are publically visible and accessible.

Additionally, FATE SIGs can also provide advice or suggestions for other teams in the FATE community: FATE Operation Team, FATE Security Team, and so on.
